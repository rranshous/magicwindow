screen which aggregates images from nodes

pieces
 - file receiver: takes POST requests of jpeg images
 - serve images: takes GET requests to root and serves up a page w/ all the images
 - cleaner: deletes files which are older than a minute, only want to show recent images

following instructions set up server and node on same host

setup node
 - install `streamer` package (`apt-get install streamer`)
   - Or `brew install imagesnap` on a mac
 - start the node script `./run_node http://localhost:5040`
 - visit http://localhost:5043/ to see all the images collected from the nodes

setup server
 - start the container which will receive the images
   `docker run -d -p 5040:80 --restart=always --name=magicwindow-file-receiver rranshous/file_receiver`
 - start container which will serve up collected images
   `docker run -d -p 5043:80 --volumes-from=magicwindow-file-receiver --restart=always --name=magicwindow-serve-images  rranshous/magicwindow-serve-images`
 - start the cleaner container, it clears out old images
   `docker run -d --volumes-from=magicwindow-file-receiver --restart=always --name=magicwindow-cleaner rranshous/magicwindow-cleaner`
